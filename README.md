# cpp_utils
Example of c++ programs
This is a collection of C++ examples that I mede through a lot of years. It contains examples of uses of some commons commands. 
There is also a OpenCL example at a separated directory that contains a VS2013 complete project. 
The opencl installation and project settings can be read at the main.hpp directory
